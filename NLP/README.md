**System requirements**
1. Python 3
2. NLTK (version 3 and above)
  2.1 nltk.download('punkt')
  2.2 nltk.download('stopwords-english')

**Testing instructions**
On the terminal, run the file as
>>python3 a3.py
#terminal outputs vocabulary size before and after processing
#OutputLog contains the vocabulary before and after stopword removal and stemming
#To use a different input file, comment out line 6 and uncomment line 7, with the relative path of the filename instead of "testfile". "testfile" was used during debugging and has been included among the uploaded files.
